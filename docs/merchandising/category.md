# üóÇÔ∏è Category Merchandising

The **Category Merchandising** feature lets you dynamically populate your Magento categories using a powerful rule engine ‚Äî no more manual product assignments.

Accessible via the Magento Admin Panel under:  
**Marketing > Meilisearch Merchandising > Category Merchandising**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it works

This interface allows you to define rules based on **filterable product attributes** (e.g., brand, color, price, etc.).  
Products that match these rules will be automatically included in the corresponding category.

You can combine multiple attribute conditions using logical groups (AND/OR), offering maximum flexibility in product selection.

## üñ±Ô∏è Drag & Drop Reordering

In addition to rule-based product assignment, you can manually adjust the **display order** of products in a category using a drag-and-drop interface.

This gives you full control over which products are featured first ‚Äî ideal for promotional campaigns, bestsellers, or seasonal highlights.
