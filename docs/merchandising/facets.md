# Facet Merchandising

The **Facet Merchandising** feature allows you to customize how layered navigation behaves and looks on your storefront — enhancing the search experience for your customers.

Accessible via the Magento Admin Panel under:  
**Marketing > Meilisearch Merchandising > Facet Merchandising**

## Configuration Options

For each filterable attribute, you can:

- 🔃 **Reorder facets** to prioritize the most relevant ones
- 🔍 **Enable a search field** within the facet values
- ➕ **Enable “Show More”** to control how many values are initially visible

These settings let you optimize the layered navigation for clarity and usability, especially in large catalogs.

## Example Use Cases

- Move the "Brand" facet to the top of the list for better visibility.
- Enable search within the "Material" facet to help users narrow down textile types.
- Limit the "Color" facet to 5 visible options, with a “Show more” toggle.
